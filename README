Raqm
====

Raqm is a small library that encapsulates the logic for complex text layout and
provide a convenient API.

It currently provides bidirectional text support (using [FriBiDi][1]), shaping
(using [HarfBuzz][2]), and proper script itemization. As a result,
Raqm can support most writing systems covered by Unicode.

The documentation can be accessed on the web at:
> http://host-oman.github.io/libraqm/

Raqm (Arabic: رَقْم) is writing, also number or digit and the Arabic word for
digital (رَقَمِيّ) shares the same root, so it is a play on “digital writing”.

Building
--------

Raqm depends on the following libraries:
* [FreeType][3]
* [HarfBuzz][2]
* [FriBiDi][1]

To build the documentation you will also need:
* [GTK-Doc][4]

And the units tests require:
* [GLib][5]

To install dependencies on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev \
                         libglib2.0-dev gtk-doc-tools

On Mac OS X you can use Homebrew:

    brew install freetype harfbuzz fribidi glib gtk-doc
    export XML_CATALOG_FILES="/usr/local/etc/xml/catalog" # for the docs

Once you have the source code and the dependencies, you can proceed to build.
To do that, run the customary sequence of commands in the source code
directory:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

To build the documentation, pass `--enable-gtk-doc` to the `configure` script.

To run the units tests:

    $ make check
