Raqm
====

Raqm is a small library that encapsulates the logic for complex text layout and
provide a convenient API.

It currently provides bidirectional text support (using [FriBiDi][1]), shaping
(using [HarfBuzz][2]), with proper script itemization. By the virtue of this,
Raqm can support most writing systems covered by Unicode.

This is an early prototype and is still work in progress. We try to not break
the API and ABI needlessly, though.

The documentation can be accessed on the web at:

Raqm (Arabic: رَقْم) is writing, also number or digit and the Arabic word for
digital (رَقَمِيّ) shares the same root, so it is a play on “digital writing”.

Building the code
=================
Raqm uses a standard autotools build system, so build instructions should be the standard ones in  *nix system such as Linux.
You will need these tools and libraries to build raqm:
```
  freetype6
  harfbuzz
  fribidi
  glib2
  gtk-doc-tools
```

### Install dependencies on ubuntu 14.04:
```
sudo apt-get install -y libfreetype6-dev libharfbuzz-dev libfribidi-dev libglib2.0-dev gtk-doc-tools;
```
### Install dependencies on OSX using Homeberw:
```
brew install freetype harfbuzz fribidi glib gtk-doc;
export XML_CATALOG_FILES="/usr/local/etc/xml/catalog";
```

Once you have the source code and the dependencies, you can proceed to build. To do that, run the customary sequence of commands in the source code directory:
```
./autogen.sh
./configure --enable-gtk-doc
make
make check
make distcheck
```
